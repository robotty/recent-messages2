        <h4>What is this?</h4>
        <p>
          Normally, on Twitch chat, you can't see any messages that were sent
          before you joined a certain channel's chat. This service fills that
          gap. It continuously listens to a large number of channels - and when
          somebody wants to open a channel's chat, their chat client can use
          this service to fetch a list of recent messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          This service is already integrated into a number of Twitch chat
          clients, such as <a href="https://chatterino.com/">Chatterino</a>{" "}
          (Windows, macOS, Linux) and{" "}
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flxrs.dankchat&hl=de">
            DankChat
          </a>{" "}
          (Android app).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
          Any chat client can integrate with this service using the provided{" "}
          <Link to="/api">API</Link>. Whenever somebody requests a channel's
          recent messages via the API, the service will open up that channel's
          chat and start listening and collecting messages. It will stay
          connected to that channel as long as somebody keeps requesting the
          history for that channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service temporarily saves messages received from all connected
          channels, for a maximum time of {config.messages_expire_after}.
          Additionally, on channels with a lot of messages, the service will not
          store more than {config.max_buffer_size} messages at once (old
          messages will be deleted to make room in case the limit is reached).
        </p>
        <p>
          If a channel's message history is not requested by anyone within a
          timespan of {config.channels_expire_after}, the service will
          automatically stop listening for messages in that channel. As the
          messages reach the expiry mark of {config.messages_expire_after}{" "}
          mentioned above, they will then also be removed.
        </p>

        <h4>What can I do here?</h4>
        <p>
          As a channel owner, you can use the{" "}
          <Link to="/settings">Settings</Link> page to disable this service for
          your channel, or just purge the currently stored recent messages as a
          one-time thing.

              I made and run this project in my free time, and I don't want to
              collect money for doing that. However <em>running</em> the service
              requires a server, which is not free. I currently pay about 26€
              per month to run this service (that's just the server costs). If
              you are feeling generous, you can help pay for the server costs by
              becoming a monthly sponsor through GitHub Sponsors, or by giving a
              one-time donation:

          If you are developing a user-facing application and planning to
          integrate with this service, you must follow these basic guidelines:
          <br />
          If feasible, you should always prefer to get user's consent via a
          opt-in before the integration is enabled for them. On the Opt-in
          dialog, include a short paragraph about what the service does and what
          feature(s) it provides in your application, and give a link to this
          website (<code>https://recent-messages.robotty.de/</code>).{" "}
          <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VjPxPBE">
            Here is a good example that you can follow.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          If it's not realistic/possible to use an opt-in system, you must at
          the very least have an opt-out settings section with the same sort of
          information that would otherwise be shown on the opt-in dialog (info
          text, opt-out toggle, link to website).
        </p>
        <p>
          If in doubt, please contact me about your integration and ask for
          help/confirmation before going forward. Contact details can be found

          oldest-to-newest. Messages are retured in raw IRC format, without
          trailing newline(s). The API returns <code>PRIVMSG</code>,{" "}
          <code>CLEARCHAT</code>, <code>CLEARMSG</code>, <code>USERNOTICE</code>

          In addition to the IRC tags originally sent by the Twitch IRC server,
          all messages additionally carry the <code>rm-received-ts</code> tag.
          Its format is similar to the <code>tmi-sent-ts</code> tag sent by
          Twitch on some message types (the value is a timestamp, it contains
          the number of milliseconds since Jan 01 1970 00:00:00 UTC, the unix
          epoch). The difference/advantage of the <code>rm-received-ts</code>{" "}
          tag is that it is present on <em>all</em> messages, allowing clients
          to use it like one would use the current clock time when receiving
          normal messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Messages that were deleted by some moderation action additionally
          carry the <code>rm-deleted=1</code> tag. Note that although typically
          one would only consider <code>PRIVMSG</code> and{" "}
          <code>USERNOTICE</code> messages to be something that "can be
          deleted", the <code>rm-deleted=1</code> can actually be placed on
          every type of message, as a result of a moderator clearing the entire
          chat.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are going to integrate the returned messages into a chat
          application that also connects to real chat at the same time, it's
          advisable to filter duplicate messages (messages that your chat client
          already received "live" that were also returned by the API). Your best
          bet is to base this on a "weak equality": Check for strict equality
          between the parsed IRC messages, but allow extra tags on the
          recent-messages one. (There is no guarantee that the tags documented
          here might not be extended one day)
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>error</code> and <code>error_code</code> parameters are
          either both <code>null</code> or both set to some string value.
          <br />
          Despite their name, if <code>error</code> and <code>error_code</code>{" "}
          are not null, it does not signifiy a hard failure of the request. The
          API will still normally return messages.{" "}
          <strong>
            Most applications should therefore ignore the <code>error</code>{" "}
            parameter
          </strong>{" "}
          and also not show it to users. Its presence is purely informational.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>error</code> is a readable error message, however it is not
          meant to be shown to the user. <code>error_code</code> is a
          machine-readable error code string.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the only valid <code>error_code</code> is{" "}
          <code>channel_not_joined</code>, which signifies that the service is
          currently not listening to messages in that channel. This error can
          arise when recent messages are requested for
          nonexistant/deleted/suspended channels, and it will also be returned
          if this request is the first request for that channel. However there
          are many more combinations of internal events that can cause ta
          channel to currently not be joined, such as a service restart, a
          reconnect, etc.
        </p>
        <h6>Errors</h6>
        If the provided channel is blacklisted from the service (ignored), HTTP
        Status Code 403 is returned with the following body:
        <pre>
          <code>
            {`{
    "status": 403,
    "status_message": "Forbidden",

    "error_code": "channel_ignored"
}`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        If the provided channel name is of invalid format, HTTP Status Code 400
        is returned with the following body:
        <pre>

      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This privacy policy will explain how I use your personal data I collect
        from you when you use my website and service.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What data do I collect? How do I collect your data? How will I use your
        data? How do I store your data?
      </h4>
      I collect the following data:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Individual chat messages sent to Twitch.tv channels that this service
          is actively listening to.
          <br />
          These chat messages are received from a public Twitch.tv messaging API
          (https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc).
          <br />
          The service only collects messages for a channel given that any user
          has requested the messages for that channel within the last{" "}
          {config.channels_expire_after}.<br />
          The service automatically stops listening to the messages sent to a
          Twitch.tv channel within the next 30 minutes once the channel's
          historical messages have not been accessed by anyone for{" "}
          {config.channels_expire_after}. A stored chat message is automatically
          permanently deleted within the next 30 minutes once it becomes older
          than {config.messages_expire_after}.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your basic Twitch.tv profile data (Twitch username, Twitch user ID,
          Link to profile picture).
          <br />
          This information is collected from the public Twitch.tv API
          (https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/).
          <br />
          This information is only collected if and when you complete the Login
          feature of the website.
          <br />
          User name and ID are only used to confirm your authorization as the
          owner of a given Twitch.tv channel (authorization).
          <br />
          The link to the profile picture is only used for the website to be
          able to show you your own profile picture. The actual profile picture
          image is not downloaded or stored at any time.
          <br />
          This information is stored on my server. Additionally, the information
          is stored in your browser's local storage to allow you to revisit the
          website without having to log in again. The information is
          automatically permanently deleted from your browser's local storage in
          case you visit the website after not having visited the website for{" "}
          {config.sessions_expire_after}. On the server-side, the information
          automatically becomes expired and inaccessible once{" "}
          {config.sessions_expire_after} have passed without you having visited
          the website with the same browser. Additionally, the information is
          also permanently from both the server as well as the browser's local
          storage if you explicitly "Log out" on the website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I justify my collection of chat messages (first point above) with
        Article 6 Section 1 Point (e) of the GDPR: "Processing shall be lawful
        only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
        [...] (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried
        out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
        vested in the controller".
      </p>
      <p>
        I justify my collection of basic Twitch.tv user data (second point
        above) because this information is strictly necessary to provide the
        user with the service and to automatically identify them.

        service will not collect messages from it anymore. Please visit the{" "}
